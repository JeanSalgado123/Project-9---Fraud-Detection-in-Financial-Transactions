# Project 9: Sentiment Analysis of E-commerce Reviews

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer sentiment in e-commerce product reviews. The main goal is to understand customer perceptions, identify positive and negative feedback trends, and provide actionable insights to improve product quality and customer satisfaction.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior by examining product review data.
- Identify patterns and trends related to positive and negative sentiment.
- Build predictive models to classify review sentiment.
- Provide insights to enhance product development and customer experience.

## Dataset
The dataset is simulated to represent product reviews on an e-commerce platform. It includes features like review text, rating, and product category.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLP techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying sentiment distribution and common patterns.
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression is used to predict sentiment based on review text.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Results
The model successfully classifies reviews with a good level of accuracy, indicating effective sentiment analysis. Key findings include:
- High accuracy in predicting positive sentiment.
- Identification of common negative words contributing to dissatisfaction.
- The analysis shows potential for improving customer satisfaction through targeted feedback.

## Key Insights
- Most customers have a positive perception of the products.
- Negative reviews often mention delivery issues or product quality.
- Enhancements in delivery and quality control could increase overall satisfaction.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate sentiment trends and model performance, such as:
- Confusion Matrix: To evaluate model accuracy.
- ROC Curve: To measure the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- Rating Distribution Plot: To show the distribution of ratings across reviews.
